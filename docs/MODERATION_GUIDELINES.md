# Moderation Guidelines

## Red Lines (Immediate Removal)

| Violation | Action |
|---|---|
| CSAM | Remove, report to NCMEC |
| Direct incitement | Remove |
| Doxxing | Remove, notify victim |
| Fraud impersonation | Remove |

## Jury-Reviewed Content

All other flagged content goes to community jury:
- Misinformation
- Hate speech
- Harassment
- Spam
- Copyright

## Jury Protocol

1. **Context** — 1 hour to review
2. **Deliberation** — 24-48 hours anonymous discussion
3. **Vote** — Keep / Remove / Restrict with rationale
4. **Majority wins** — Ties default to Keep

## Liberal Defaults

- We do not auto-remove "toxicity"
- Swear words trigger gentle prompt, not removal
- Context matters (satire, education protected)

## Transparency

All moderation statistics published quarterly.
