# Juror Training

Welcome to seethru.media content moderation.

## Your Role

You are part of a randomly-selected jury that reviews flagged content. Your job is to apply our policies fairly and consistently.

## The Process

1. **Context** (1 hour): Review the flagged content and reporter's reason
2. **Deliberation** (24-48 hours): Anonymous discussion with other jurors
3. **Voting** (24 hours): Vote Keep/Remove/Restrict with rationale

## Red Lines (Never Goes to Jury)

These are handled by staff immediately:
- CSAM (child sexual abuse material)
- Direct incitement to violence
- Doxxing (publishing private info)
- Fraud impersonation

## What You Judge

- Misinformation
- Hate speech
- Harassment
- Spam
- Copyright claims

## Key Principles

1. **Lean toward keeping content** when in doubt
2. **Context matters** — satire, news reporting, and education are protected
3. **Your identity is anonymous** — vote your conscience
4. **Document your reasoning** — future cases may reference this

## Accountability

Jurors whose decisions are frequently overturned on appeal lose eligibility for 90 days.
