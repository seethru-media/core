# The seethru.media Charter

**Version 1.0**

## Preamble

Media shapes how we see the world. When media incentives are broken—optimizing for outrage, addiction, and obscurity—our shared reality breaks.

**seethru.media** exists to demonstrate a different model: journalism infrastructure built on **trust, transparency, and user agency**.

## The Covenant

This Charter establishes the inviolable rights of our readers and the duties of our contributors. It binds the platform to the following operating principles:

### I. The Right to Understanding
We optimize for clarity, not engagement. We reject "doomscrolling" mechanics, infinite feeds designed for addiction, and algorithms that amplify conflict for profit.
👉 **[Read the Trust Principles](./TRUST_PRINCIPLES.md)**

### II. The Right to Privacy
We do not track our users. We do not use cookies, pixels, or fingerprinting. We believe privacy is a prerequisite for free thought.
👉 **[See Data Policy](./DATA_POLICY.md)**

### III. The Duty of Transparency
We operate in the sunlight.
*   **Algorithms**: Our ranking logic is open source.
*   **Finances**: Our revenue and expenses are public.
*   **Decisions**: Our moderation logs are visible.
👉 **[View Funding Registry](./FUNDING_REGISTRY.md)**

### IV. The Power of Community
We believe in liberal moderation with strict red lines, enforced by community juries, not invisible administrators.
👉 **[Moderation Guidelines](./MODERATION_GUIDELINES.md)**

## Amendment

This Charter defines the soul of the project. While it can be amended to evolve with the platform, its core spirit of transparency and user agency cannot be severed.
