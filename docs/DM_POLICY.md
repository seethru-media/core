# DM Policy

## What We Can Do

| Capability | Yes | No |
|---|---|---|
| Read message content | | ✗ |
| Rate-limit new accounts | ✓ | |
| Analyze metadata (timing, frequency) | ✓ | |
| Act on user reports | ✓ | |
| Block/ban abusive accounts | ✓ | |

## What This Means

Direct messages on seethru.media are **end-to-end encrypted**. This means:

1. **We cannot read them.** Even if law enforcement asks, we don't have access.
2. **We cannot proactively detect abuse.** No keyword scanning is possible.
3. **We rely on user reports.** If someone harasses you, report with screenshots.

## This is a Tradeoff

We believe privacy is worth this tradeoff. But be aware:
- We cannot guarantee abuse-free DMs
- Block aggressively; we will support you

## Retention

Messages are automatically deleted after 30 days.

## Reporting

To report DM abuse:
1. Screenshot the conversation
2. Submit report through your settings
3. We will review metadata and take action
