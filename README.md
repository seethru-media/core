# seethru.media

**A trust-first news platform.** No outrage optimization. No hidden algorithms. No cookies.

---

## What We're Building

seethru.media is an open-source news platform designed for radical transparency:

| Traditional Media | seethru.media |
|---|---|
| Optimizes for engagement | Optimizes for understanding |
| Hidden algorithms | [Open-source ranking](./docs/ALGORITHM_TRANSPARENCY.md) |
| Anonymous moderation | [Public jury decisions](./docs/MODERATION_GUIDELINES.md) |
| Unclear funding | [Public finances](./docs/FUNDING_REGISTRY.md) |
| Tracks everything | No cookies. No fingerprinting. |

## Core Principles

1. **Geographic Daily Briefs** — News organized by your neighborhood, city, country, then world. Not by what makes you angry.

2. **Visible Attribution** — Every piece of content shows who made it, who funded it, and whether AI was involved.

3. **Liberal Moderation** — We don't auto-censor "toxicity." Only 4 absolute red lines: CSAM, direct incitement, doxxing, fraud. Everything else goes to a [community jury](./docs/juror-training/README.md).

4. **Forkable Governance** — Don't like how we run things? All governance documents are [open source](./docs/AMENDMENT_PROCESS.md) and [CC-BY-SA licensed](./LICENSE). Fork us.

5. **Privacy by Default** — No cookies. Server-side sessions only when you opt in. [See what we track](./docs/DATA_POLICY.md).

Content lives in separate repositories ("Fuel"):
- Each subdomain has its own content repo
- Content is MDX + assets, no code
- Authors don't need to understand the infrastructure

## Governance

We believe platform governance should be as transparent as the content.

| Document | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| **[The Platform Charter](./docs/CHARTER.md)** | **Constitutional foundation** |
| [Trust Principles](./docs/TRUST_PRINCIPLES.md) | Our commitments to readers |
| [Moderation Guidelines](./docs/MODERATION_GUIDELINES.md) | How we handle content |
| [Ombudsman](./docs/OMBUDSMAN.md) | Independent oversight |
| [DM Policy](./docs/DM_POLICY.md) | Honest about what we can't see |
| [Funding Registry](./docs/FUNDING_REGISTRY.md) | Who funds us |
| [Amendment Process](./docs/AMENDMENT_PROCESS.md) | How rules change |
